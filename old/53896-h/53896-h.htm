<h2>MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENTS</h2>


<p>These songs can be used in all manner of entertainments. The
music is easy and both music and words are especially catchy. Children
like them. Everybody likes them. Sheet music. Price, 35 cents each.</p>

<p><b>HERE’S TO THE LAND OF THE STARS AND THE STRIPES.</b>
(Bugbee-Worrell.) A patriotic song which every child should know and
love. The sentiment is elevating. The music is martial and inspiring.
May be effectively sung by the entire school. Suitable for any occasion
and may be sung by children or grown-ups. Be the first to use this
song in your community.</p>

<p><b>I’LL NEVER PLAY WITH YOU AGAIN.</b> (Guptill-Weaver.) A
quarrel between a small boy and girl. The words are defiant and pert.
The boy and his dog have been in mischief, and the small maiden poutingly
declares that she will never play with him again, but changes her
mind in the last verse. A taking little duet for any occasion, with full
directions for motions.</p>

<p><b>JOLLY FARMER LADS AND LASSIES.</b> (Irish-Lyman.) A decidedly
humorous action song prepared especially for district schools.
It will make a hit wherever produced.</p>

<p><b>JOLLY PICKANINNIES.</b> (Worrell.) Introduce this coon song
into your next entertainment. If you use the directions for the motions
which accompany the music, the pickaninnies will bring down the
house. Their black faces and shining eyes will guarantee a “hit.” The
words are great and the music just right.</p>

<p><b>LULLABY LANE.</b> (Worrell.) This song is one which the children,
once having learned, will never forget. The words have the charm
of the verses written by Robert Louis Stevenson. The music is equally
sweet and is perfectly suited to the beautiful words. It may be sung
as a solo by a little girl with a chorus of other little girls with dolls, or
as a closing song by the whole school.</p>

<p><b>MY OWN AMERICA, I LOVE BUT THEE.</b> (Worrell.) Here
is a song that will arouse patriotism in the heart of every one who
hears it. The music is so catchy that the children and grown-ups, too,
just can’t resist it. It makes a capital marching song.</p>

<p><b>NOW, AREN’T YOU GLAD YOU CAME?</b> (Guptill-Weaver.)
This is a closing song which is quite out of the ordinary. There is
humor in every line. The music is lively. Your audience will not
soon forget this spicy song for it will get many an unexpected laugh.
The motions which accompany this song make it doubly effective. For
any occasion and for any number of children.</p>

<p><b>WE ARE CREEPY LITTLE SCARECROWS.</b> (Guptill-Weaver.)
A weird, fascinating action song. You can’t go wrong with this song.
There are four verses and chorus. Complete directions accompany this
song so that it may be featured as a song and drill, if desired. For any
occasion and for any number of children.</p>

<p><b>WE’VE JUST ARRIVED FROM BASHFUL TOWN.</b> (Worrell.)
This song will bring memories to the listeners of their own bashful
school days. They will recall just how “scared” they were when asked
to sing or play or speak. The words are unusually clever. The music
is decidedly melodious. It makes a capital welcome song or it may be
sung at any time on any program with assured success.</p>

<p><b>WE HOPE YOU’VE BROUGHT YOUR SMILES ALONG.</b> (Worrell.)
A welcome song that will at once put the audience in a joyous
frame of mind and create a happy impression that will mean half the
success of your entire program. Words, bright and inspiring. Music,
catchy. A sure hit for your entertainment.</p>

<p><b>WE’LL NOW HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.</b> (Worrell.) This
beautiful song has snap and go that will appeal alike to visitors and
singers. It is just the song to send your audience home with happy
memories of the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hill</span>—My, my, well I remember the time, teacher,

<p><span class="smcap">Teacher</span>—We are very, very glad you came. I should
have been very, very disappointed if no one came to visit
(<i>she seats Mrs. Skaggs by Mrs. Hill</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Skaggs</span>—I hope you haint had none the speakin’
yet. I’d hate dreadful bad to miss any of it. As I was
sayin’ to Hen—that’s my husban’—I says, Hen, there aint a
single thing I like to hear better’n children speakin’ pieces.
I think it’s dreadful nice, even when they make mistakes.
As I says to Hen, we can’t expect ’em to do too good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ole</span> (<i>pointing off stage</i>)—Oh, teacher, yust look who’s

to be present at—that is, to attend, and injoy—that is, to

childern of the deestrict with my presence here an’ see how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
they’re gittin’ on. Be they doin’ purty good, teacher? (<i>looks

<p><span class="smcap">Teacher</span>—We’re very, very glad you came, Mr. Judd.
Yes, they’re doin’ real well (<i>she seats him</i>). Now, children

(<i>Billy sobs softly</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah Jane</span> (<i>waving hand</i>)—Teacher, teacher, Billy’s

with his hand and keeps time with his head; the two visitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
beat time with foot. The children sing with a great deal of
spirit</i>).</p>

with long strides, smoothes his hair, fixes his collar, straightens
his coat, blows his nose, then takes a paper from his
pocket and reads; high tone and sing-song</i>).</p>

25th day of December. Christmas is when Santa Claus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
comes with presents. Christmas is when we hang up our
stockings to get presents. Christmas is when we have
Christmas trees with presents on. Christmas is when folks
has company or goes visitin’. On Christmas day folks say
Merry Christmas to each other. Christmas day don’t last
long but it is a long time gettin’ here. It is more blessed
to give Christmas than to receive it. Christmas is a merry
day (<i>bows low and takes seat</i>).</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
